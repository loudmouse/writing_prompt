The pillows smells of moth balls and old people. An angry dog snarls from the trailer down the alley. An engine fires up and the ignition is revved. A young man hunches over a motorbike. Greased stained hands and tattooed forearms he tinkers at the steaming carburetor. In the air above him a hawk circles in the clear blue skies. In the distance a bonfire sends tendrils of smoke into the air. Dry leaves from the cool, dirt ground smolder in the dancing flames. The leaves beneath my own feet crumple beneath my leather boots. They crunch as I hike the circle around the neighborhood. Tiny wooden houses dot themselves behind the small lawns behind the broken stone sidewalks. A flag waves from a flagpole in the front lawn of the house on the corner. A small sign swings from rusted chains. Painted in black lettering on white peeling paint it says Town Hall. The people whoâ€™s town this was have all since passed on. This ghost town decays more and more each year. My chest tightens and an ocean like salty water fills up in my eyes. Over the roof tops a short walk back the old steeple rises up to the sky. The people gone it stands abandoned. The white paint is all but a memory much like the sermons that no longer reverberate within its walls. A church hymn from the heavens echoes out and lightning flashes across the sky. Dark menacing clouds tumble in from the west. The air carries that smell. My knees begin to ache as the cool water begins to fall from above."
